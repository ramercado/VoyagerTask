# VoyagerTask
~ VoyagerTask is a bash script which will check memory usage
~ On my rescent upload file for memory usage, it seems that the warning mail that should be send to admin email is not working
that maybe i should configure something on my CentOS, but i think the code i use for that is fine.
Hi, recently just finish uploading the task#2 which is the puppet coding, hopefully it works.
